     I am currently working at 8x8 as the API Product Owner. I am part of a team developing our public API program. 
     As a member of the Product Management team I work with our globally distributed developer teams on the best way 
     to present their APIs to our customers. I  help our development teams in Cluj, London, and Singapore develop both 
     customer facing reference and use case information. 
     
     8x8 has an incredible data platform and these APIs enable our customers to access a great deal of enterprise information.
     
     When I started at 8x8 there was no structured public API program in place. I was able to get the conversation started
     amongst the disparate development teams as to strategy and standardized processes. 
     
     I enjoy learning about all areas of our APIs which enables me to be a go-to person for knowledge and queries within 
     the Product and the other teams. I am always looking to suggest improvements and challenge what and how we are working 
     to make sure we are delivering the best service
