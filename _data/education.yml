    During my time at Santa Clara University I enhanced my business skills and acumen and learnt key business skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    Part of business school coursework is the membership in team cohorts for each course. MOre often than not I would lead my student cohort and drive the completion of our team assignments and deliverables.
